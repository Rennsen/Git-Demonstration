# Git-Demonstration

Welcome to Git-Demonstration! This repository serves as a practical example used for a video demonstration on version control and collaboration, specifically tailored for a web development project.

## Description

Git-Demonstration provides a hands-on demonstration of version control and collaboration concepts using Git. In this project, users will be guided through the process of contributing to a simulated database environment. The main features include:

- **User Identification**: Users are prompted to enter their ID credentials.
- **ID Generation**: The application generates a unique ID consisting of four numbers for each user.
- **Database Simulation**: Users manually add their generated ID to a database code, simulating the database environment and structure.
